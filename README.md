# Oracle Kubernetes Engine first steps

First steps with Docker, Kubernetes and Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE).

We are going to build, dockerize and deploy an application with this architecture.

![Architecture](images/use-case.jpg)

What do we cover?

- Create a Kubernetes cluster with Oracle Cloud.
- Explain virtual machines, containers, Docker, registry, and Kubernetes.
- Dockerize your application
- Run your application locally.
- Configure `kubectl` to talk to your cluster.
- Deploy your application in OKE

## Virtual Machines

It is a **virtualization** of a computer system.

Through software, it **simulates the underlying hardward**. The software is called **hyper-visor**.

Examples: VirtualBox, QEMU, Hyper-V, VMWare, etc.

There are two types but they work in a similar way:

On top of that virtual system you **install a complete operative system**.

## Containers

**Lightweight virtualization technology** based on Linux kernel.

It produces **portable images** that you can run in any Linux host machine.

It has a **fast start time**.

The unterlying technology: `cgroups` and `namespaces` of Linux kernel.

- `cgroups` is "what you can use" from your host machine. Memory, CPU, block I/O, network, ...
- `namespaces` is "what you can see" from your host machine. Pid, net, mnt, uts, ipc, ...

### Why containers is useful

Compare virtual machines and containers stack:

Containers

It **streamline the pipeline** of development, testing and deployment of applications.

Developers can modify the code, run them in containers that isolate the execution from the local developer machine (**the end of "it works on my machine"**).

When developer is ready, it can push the code to the repository what kick off a remote building that **create container images** and **archive them in a repository of images**.

After that, Operations can **take those images and deployment** in testing and production enviroments.

The whole process is creating deliverables isolated from local hacks to make it work on a specific environment.

Because is a lightweight virtualization technology, spinning new containers from an image is quick and easy. Perfect to **scale your application on demand**.

## Docker

Docker is the most popular container technology. Docker is just a toolkit that abstract the complexity of `cgroups` and `namespaces`.

Docker images are composed by layers of modifications on top of based images.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an **open-source** system for **automating deployment**, **scaling** and **management of containerized applications**. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

## Dockerize your application

Dockerfile contains the instructions to build a docker image.

Build your image:

`docker build -t oke-first-steps/web .`

##Â Run your application locally

Run locally a container from your image:

`docker run -p 4000:4000 -d oke-first-steps/web`

Tag an image:
`docker tag ...` XXX

## Push images to registry

Repository of Docker images, tagged with a version or code name.

Developers or CI tools can **push** images to the repository.

Kubernetes and developers can **pull** images to be run.
