# Oracle Kubernetes Engine First Steps

First steps with Docker, Kubernetes and Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE).

We are going to build, dockerize and deploy an application.

## Key takeaways

- Understand concepts like virtual machines, containers, Docker, container registry, and Kubernetes.
- Create a Kubernetes cluster with Oracle Cloud.
- Dockerize your application.
- Run your application locally with Docker.
- Configure `kubectl` to talk to your cluster.
- Deploy your application in Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE).
- Scale up and down your application
- Create an ingress controller (Work in progress...)

## Requirements

In order to follow this hands-on lab you need an active Oracle Cloud account.

If you don't have one already, what are you waiting for? You can create one on [Sign-up for a free Oracle Cloud account](http://bit.ly/34TzwGf).

Follow the steps and you will receive an email with details to log-in. Sometimes it might take few minutes to fully provision your account.

You will need a public and private key.

You will also need Docker installed on your machine. Go to [Docker official](https://docs.docker.com/install/) page.
